# Drug Usage Pattern Classification

This project applies machine learning models to identify drug usage patterns using national survey data. It compares SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers, addresses class imbalance using hybrid sampling techniques, and applies SHAP for model interpretability.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Hybrid sampling for imbalanced classes
- SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Model evaluation and explainability using SHAP

## Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
